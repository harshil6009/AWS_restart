# A while loop makes a section of code repeat until a certain condition is met. In this exercise, you will create a Python script that asks the user to correctly guess a number.

print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
print('The rules are simple')
print('I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.')
import random
number = random.randint(1,10)
isGuessRight = False
while isGuessRight != True:
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
    if int(guess) == number:
        print("You guessed {}. That is correct! You win!".format(guess))
        isGuessRight = True
    else:
        print("You guessed {}. Sorry, that isnâ€™t it. Try again.".format(guess))
